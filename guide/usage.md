Welcome to the usage page of SB-RPC. On this page, we will explain how you can use the project after you [set it up](./setup.md "Read how to set it up here before starting!"). Without it being set up, it can't be used.


To use the project, make sure your `background.vbs` file is located in the shell:startup folder (See the [setup](./setup.md "Read how to set it up here before starting!")). Go to your server you created for this, and join the voice channel (The one you have in your config.json). Go to your requests channel, and use the `/play` command (From StormBeatz) to start any music you want. It should work now! If it doesn't, please check the setup [setup](./setup.md "Read how to set it up here before starting!") steps or create an [issue](https://github.com/Luckie6313/StormBeatz-rpc/issues "Open an issue if you have a problem or question.") *if it isn't a duplicate*.
